Embed Branch conversations in your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Bring Branch conversations to your WordPress site. Embed a conversation in a post using a shortcode or oEmbed.

For the former, you'll add something like this to your post:

`[branch]http://beta.branch.com/owning-your-own-words-is-it-important-1[/branch]`

If you have oEmbed enabled for your site, you can add the Branch URL to a new line and the embed will generate automatically.
